SQL Assignment

You will be expected to utilise your knowledge of creating SQL databases.

Picking any topic of your choice, you will generate a database using the SQLite software.

The database will contain at least 1000 rows and 7 columns, where at least one column has nominal data, at least one has ordinal data, at least one has interval data and at least one has ratio data. Extra marks will be awarded for the utilisation of foreign and compound keys across multiple tables. Randomised data covering all appropriate data types will be further rewarded.

You will submit a PDF report with screenshots/pasted code about:

How you generated the data (do not download other people's data).
The schema of your database.
Your justification for any separate tables and ethical discussion.
Example queries of your database including joins and selections, demonstrating different data types.
